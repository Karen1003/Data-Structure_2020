# Data-Structure_2020
Coursework of Data Structure course in 2020
## Hw1
This is a simple praticing coursework before class. 
### Function:
Letting user imput several intergers and find the min, 2nd_min, max, 2nd_max, sum and product.
## Hw2
### Function:
First, User can choose how many questions he or she wants to answer. Then the system will randomly generate the corresponding number of simple mathematical questions. After user answers each question, he or she will know if the answer is correct or not. Finally, system will calculate the average correct rate for the user.
## Hw3
### Function:
This programming is about practicing insertion sort and merge sort. After user inputs several numbers, system will sort them in ascending order by two different algorithms.
## Hw4
### Function:
This code is to first input a txt file.Second,enqueue and dequeue the number by doubly linked list into the queue.
Each time you dequeue,the number needs to be converted into its binary form.
Then store the calculated binary numbers into stack by singly linked lists.Finally.pop those numbers and print out
## Hw5
### Function:
This programming is about practicing heap sort and quick sort.
This is to let user input a natual number n, a lower bound a_min, an upper bound a_max.
Then the program will randomly generate n numbers which are between a_min and a_max.
Finally,sort these numbers by two different algorithms.
## Hw6
### Function:
This programming is about comparing the efficiency of 7 different sorting algorithm.
